\title{Integrates VDJ and gene expression libraries by providing cluster membership seq_per_vdj object and the index of the cell in the Seurat RNA-seq object.}
\usage{
GEX_phenotype_per_clone(automate_GEX.output, clonotype.ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{automate_GEX.output}{A single seurat object from automate_GEX function. This will likely be supplied as automate_GEX.output[[1]] for an individual set of integrated repertoires.}

\item{clonotype.ids}{Output from either VDJ_analyze or VDJ_clonotype functions. This list should correspond to a single GEX.list object, in which each list element in clonotype.list is found in the GEX.object. Furthermore, these repertoires should be found in the automate_GEX library.}
}
\value{
Returns a stacked barplot that visualizes the seurat cluster membership for different cell phenotypes.
