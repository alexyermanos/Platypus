\alias{VDJ_Vgene_usage_stacked_barplot}
\title{Produces a stacked barplot with the fraction of the most frequently used IgH and IgK/L Vgenes. This function can be used in combination with the VDJ_Vgene_usage_barplot to vizualize V gene usage per sample and among samples.}
\usage{
VDJ_Vgene_usage_stacked_barplot(
  VDJ,
  HC.gene.number,
  Fraction.HC,
  LC.Vgene,
  LC.gene.number,
  Fraction.LC,
  platypus.version
)
}
\arguments{
\item{VDJ}{Either (for platypus version "v2") output from VDJ_analyze function. This should be a list of clonotype dataframes, with each list element corresponding to a single VDJ repertoire, OR (for platypus version "v3") the the VDJ matrix output of the VDJ_GEX_matrix() function (normally VDJ.GEX.matrix.output[[1]])}

\item{HC.gene.number}{Numeric value indicating the top genes to be dispayed. If this number is higher than the total number of unique HC V genes in the VDJ repertoire, then this number is equal to the number of unique HC V genes.}

\item{Fraction.HC}{Numeric value indicating the minimum fraction of clones expressing a particular HC V gene. If the usage of a particular gene is below this value, then this gene is excluded. If the usage of a particular gene is above this value even in one sample, then this gene is included in the analysis. Default value is set to 0, thus all genes are selected.}

\item{LC.Vgene}{Logical indicating whether to make a barplot of the LC V gene distribution. Default is set to FALSE.}

\item{LC.gene.number}{Numeric value indicating the top genes to be dispayed. If this number is higher than the total number of unique LC V genes in the VDJ repertoire, then this number is equal to the number of unique LC V genes.}

\item{Fraction.LC}{Numeric value indicating the minimum fraction of clones expressing a particular LC V gene. If the usage of a particular gene is below this value, then this gene is excluded. If the usage of a particular gene is above this value even in one sample, then this gene is included in the analysis. Default value is set to 0, thus all genes are selected.}

\item{platypus.version}{Set according to input format to either "v2" or "v3". Defaults to "v3"}
}
\value{
Returns a list of ggplot objects which show the stacked distribution of IgH and IgK/L V genes for the most used V genes. Returns an empty plot if the Fraction.HC or Fraction.LC that were selected were too high, resulting in the exclusion of all the genes.
